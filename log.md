### Day 1: January 2, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Make a plan for updating and improving my Python skills. Familiarizing with Docker, GitHub

**Details**:

 - As an easy refresher, I created a simple virtual PyPet following a fun little tutorial from https://www.thinkful.com/learn/intro-to-python-tutorial/Friends-for-your-Pypet#Friends-for-your-Pypet
 - Made a list of interesting coding challenges and resources to improve my Python skills
 - I followed some tutorials (shame on me!) to better understand how to use Docker which I'll use to run my work code
 
 Plans: 
 - I realized I need more experience with GitHub, and also figure out from which work station I'll be uploading code, this is something I'll work on in the near future, to be able to actually upload my projects.
 - I will have to avoid to work on too many things simultaneously in this new stage of work with little support and many new things to learn. It's a challenge to close paths down for now, yet I expect the log file to show it will benefit my output.
