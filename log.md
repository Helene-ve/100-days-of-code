### Day 1: July 11, 2019

**Today's Focus**: Make a plan for updating and improving my Python skills. Familiarizing with Docker, GitHub

**Details**:

 - As an easy refresher, I created a simple virtual PyPet following a fun little tutorial from https://www.thinkful.com/learn/intro-to-python-tutorial/Friends-for-your-Pypet#Friends-for-your-Pypet
 - Made a list of interesting coding challenges and resources to improve my Python skills
 - I followed some tutorials (shame on me!) to better understand how to use Docker which I'll use to run my work code
 
 Plans: 
 - I realized I need more experience with GitHub, and also figure out from which work station I'll be uploading code, this is something I'll work on in the near future, to be able to actually upload my projects.
 - I will have to avoid to work on too many things simultaneously in this new stage of work with little support and many new things to learn. It's a challenge to close paths down for now, yet I expect the log file to show it will benefit my output.

### Day 2: July 12, 2019
**Today's Focus**: Tested approaches to learn and train Python. 

**Details**: I made an attempt to steer clear from plain tutorials in favour of interactive learning preferably geared towards Data Scientists. I gave CodeCombat a shot, finished the first dungeon, but found it too slow, simple and tedious to actually advance in coding. Finxter is a nice test to gauge the current level of your coding skills, I use it at the moment to test the commands I know, so advancing only slowly there. Sololearn gives a good phone app, even useable offline which is very useful during vacation times. I try to finish one module a day. Lastly I am using DataCamp as a resource. No code to show for this orientation day, which feels unrewarding and I will therefore change strategies.

### Day 3: July 15, 2019
**Today's Focus**: Find coding challenges at my appropriate level

**Details**: I've started Checkio which asks for small programs yet provides a bit of help to get started. Programmed "All the same" and "House Password" which are simple input checker modules. Decided on Spyder as preferred IDE, this seems most natural for me as Matlab user, allthough Jupyter notebooks are on the programme for the future. Advanced on Finxter from Basic Knowledge to Beginner.

### Day 4: July 16, 2019
**Today's Focus**: Test current level and learn

**Details**: At Finxter, I advanced from Beginner to Autodidact to Scholar to Learner. I find several new functions that I learned. On Checkio Iâ€™ve found my match in a moderate challenge that proves too difficult to solve in one day. Learning mostly today about dictionary manipulations.

### Day 5: July 17, 2019
**Today's Focus**: Access file names

**Details**: Working on my work problem, I have broken down the goal (create a machine learning algorithm to predict errors from sound data) in baby steps. The first step is to actually access the data, which is hidden away on a server (most of the work went into finding and accessing. With use of https://realpython.com/working-with-files-in-python/ I wrote a bit of code to read file names. Further, at Finxter, I advanced from Learner to Experienced Learner to Intermediate.

### Day 6: July 18, 2019
**Today's Focus**: Make a spectrogram

**Details**: I've worked on the code for yesterday to read in a sound file and create a spectrogram of it. 

**Examples**:
